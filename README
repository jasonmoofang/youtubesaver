A small Qt program that lets you preview loaded/cached flash videos, and
export/save them as flv/mp3 files on linux (and possibly other unixy) systems.

Basically for most online flash videos, when you load it on your browser, the
video gets cached somewhere in your system (nowadays, in a deleted, but still-
open file. True story). YoutubeSaver finds and lists the cached videos in a nice
interface and lets you do shit with them.

I hacked this up for my mother some time ago, and, as lazy people often do,
never got round to writing a proper installation script, so you'll have
to go about it manually.

You can use the normal cmake build process:

> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make

to create the YoutubeSaver executable, which you can then copy to a convenient
location in your PATH. (A template desktop file with icon is also included if
you want to "install" it in a more appealing way)

For YoutubeSaver to work, you need to make the scripts 'flv-to-mp3' and
'showflashcache' executable and put them in your PATH.

You'll also need
 - ffmpeg
 - lame
 - smplayer
 
installed for everything to work properly.
